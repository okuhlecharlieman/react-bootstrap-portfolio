                            <p>I spent four formative years at my primary school,
                                from grade 4 through 7, where I gained a strong foundation in education and
                                formed many cherished memories that have stayed with me to this day
                                </p>

<p>After completing my primary education,
     I moved on to a new school where I 
     completed my high school education from grade 8 through 12,
      eventually earning my matric in 2017. Those five years were a time of personal growth,
       academic challenges,
     and memorable experiences that have helped shape who I am today

Upon graduating from matric in 2017, 
I eagerly embarked on my tertiary education at Nelson Mandela University, 
where I pursued a degree in Information Technology with a focus on software development. 
I dove headfirst into my studies and relished the opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills in this dynamic field
