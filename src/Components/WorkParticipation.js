                    <p className="text-light-muted mb-4">
                      After completing my IT diploma, I sought out new
                      opportunities and decided to make the move to Cape Town.
                      It was there that I landed my first job at Raydian, where
                      I worked as a printer technician. In this role, I was
                      responsible for the installation and maintenance of
                      printers, ensuring that they ran smoothly and efficiently
                      for our clients. It was a challenging yet rewarding
                      experience that allowed me to hone my technical skills and
                      develop my customer service abilities.

                      After completing my primary education, I worked as a sales
                      associate at Total Sports, where I had the opportunity to
                      interact with customers, understand their needs, and
                      recommend the right solutions to help them. It was a great
                      experience that allowed me to develop my communication and
                      customer service skills, as well as my knowledge of
                      various sports products and equipment.

                      I'm currently enrolled in the systems development pathway,
                      which is designed to bridge the skills gap in software
                      engineering. This program offers a comprehensive
                      curriculum that covers both front-end and back-end web
                      development, with 12 modules aligned to SETA unit
                      standards. I have the flexibility to select and combine
                      modules such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Java to
                      create personalized 6-month programs. Upon completion,
                      I'll have the opportunity to earn industry certifications
                      like Microsoft Python Certification and Oracle Java
                      Certification. The program is fully aligned to the
                      National Qualifications Framework (NQF) Unit Standards,
                      which will ensure that I'm equipped with the necessary
                      skills and knowledge to excel in this exciting field.
