                      After earning my IT diploma, I relocated to Cape Town and
                      secured my first job at Raydian as a printer technician.
                      In this position, I was responsible for installing and
                      maintaining printers to ensure optimal performance for our
                      clients. This role was both challenging and rewarding,
                      providing me with the opportunity to enhance my technical
                      skills and customer service expertise.

                      After completing my primary education, I worked as a sales
                      associate at Total Sports, where I had the opportunity to
                      interact with customers, understand their needs, and
                      recommend the right solutions to help them. It was a great
                      experience that allowed me to develop my communication and
                      customer service skills, as well as my knowledge of
                      various sports products and equipment.

                      I enrolled in a systems development program that addressed
                      the software engineering skills gap. The curriculum
                      covered front-end and back-end web development with
                      flexible module choices like HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                      Python, and Java. Upon completion, industry certifications
                      like Microsoft Python and Oracle Java were available. The
                      program aligned with National Qualifications Framework
                      (NQF) standards, providing the skills needed for success
                      in the field.
